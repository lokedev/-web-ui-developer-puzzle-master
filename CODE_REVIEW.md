Code Smells:

Added Unsubscribe to avoid memory leakage in Book Search Component.
Show no search results when item is not available.


Accessibiltiy Issues:

Aria-labels is missing to logo, Reading List button, Search textfield, Search Icon
Added Tabindex to logo, Reading List button, Remove Book, Close button

Improvements:

show loader during search api call.
Good to have Lazy loading to search results when there are more items. 
Implement Unsubcribe if we are moving from one component to another.
