code smells:
1) Added Unsubscribe to avoid memory leakage in Book Search Component 


Accessibiltiy Issues:
1) Aria-labels is missing to logo, Reading List button, Search textfield
2) Added Tabindex to logo, Reading List button

Improvements:
1) Good to have Lazy loading to search results. 
2) Implement Unsubcribe if we are moving from one component to another.
